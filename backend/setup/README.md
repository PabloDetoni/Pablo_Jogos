# Backend setup files

This folder contains small helper files and documentation used to initialise and test the backend.

Files moved here:
- API_DOCUMENTATION.md: API notes / docs.
- testa_db.js: simple script to test DB connection via database.js

Keep package.json and .env in the backend root (required by npm and runtime).
